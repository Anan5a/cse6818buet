FUNCTION GenerateForensicReport(findings_list, file_hash)
START
AGGREGATE the findings and calculate\
    the Frequency (Hit Count) for each unique artifact.
SORT the artifacts by Hit Count in descending order.
CREATE a new CSV report in the /reports \
    directory using the current system time.
WRITE the Evidence Hash to the file header for the Chain of Custody.
FOR EACH unique artifact:
    EXPORT (Hits, Timestamp, Browser, Incognito, URL) to the CSV.
END

FUNCTION AnalyzeMemory(dump_file_path)
START
VALIDATE that dump_file_path exists on the host.
OPEN the file in binary mode.
MAP the entire file into a virtual memory address space (mmap) for high-speed access.
CALCULATE the SHA256 hash of the mapped data to ensure evidence integrity.
FIND all occurrences of the URL Pattern using a regular expression.
    FOR EACH match discovered:
    CLEAN and DECODE the URL string.
    FILTER out "noise" (e.g., ad-trackers, stylesheets, scripts).
    DEFINE a 1KB Context Window immediately preceding the URL.
    IF the context window contains > 90% null bytes (Zero-Check):
        SKIP (assumed to be fragmented or orphaned data).
    SCAN the context window for Browser Signatures (Firefox, Chrome, Brave).
    IF no browser signature is found:
        SKIP (cannot attribute the URL to a specific application).
    CHECK for Incognito Flags (--incognito, --private-window) in the context window.
    PERFORM binary carving for Timestamps:
        Iterate backwards 64 bytes in the context window.
        Attempt to unpack bytes as 8-byte PRTime (Firefox) or 4-byte Unix Epoch (Chrome).
        IF the resulting date is within the Valid Forensic Range (2023–2030):
            SAVE the timestamp and stop searching.
ADD the (Timestamp, Browser, Incognito Status, URL) to the Findings List.
RETURN Findings List and File Hash.
